<h2>About this website</h2>
<p>This is a personal website which is owned and created by Qiao Gao.</p>
<p>As one of those who have a childhood dream of building a personal website, it is not hard to imagine how exciting I was when I finally decided 
to really work on it. Without any background of web coding, I almostly teach myself everything such as html, css, rake, etc.
However, without the help from other people, there would be no possibility for me to get so far. Thanks to the continuing support of
my parents, it is you who tell me to never abandon my dream. Thanks to all my friends who help me do website test and provide advices
without hesitation. Thanks to w3school which provides perfect online cources. And also Github and Jekyll, which is the best combination
for web developer. This is just a simple website, but till now I totally understand that even the most simple thing of this modern 
world is a accumulation of people's passions, efforts and dreams. </p>

<p class="justifyp">Finally, thank you for reading so far. </p>
