<h2>About this website</h2>
<p>This is a personal website which is owned and created by Qiao Gao.</p>
<p>As the one with a childhood dream of building a personal website, It is not hard to imagine how exciting I am when I finally decide 
to really working on it. Without any background of web coding, I teach myself about almost everything such as html, css, rake, etc.
However, without the help from other people, there would be no possibility for me to get so far. Thanks to the continuing support of
my parents, it is you who tell me to never abandon my dream. Thanks to all my friends who help me do website test and provide advices
without hesitation. Thanks to w3school which provides perfect online cources. And also Github and Jekyll, which is the best combination
for web developer. This is just a so simple website, but till now I totally understand that even the most simple stuff of this modern 
world is a accumulation of people's passions, efforts and dreams. </p>

<p>This website is totally open source. The source code can be find at my Github:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/qiaogao/qiaogao.github.io">https://github.com/qiaogao/qiaogao.github.io</a>.</p> 
<p>Please be free to use everything inside.</p>

<p class="justifyp">Finally, thank you for reading so far. </p>
