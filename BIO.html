<p>Qiao Gao was born on July 11th, 1989 in Zhengzhou China. At the age of 3, he showed great interests on playing a DOS Pool game on the computer in his father's office. Noticing his curiosity on computers, his parents sent him to a primary school that provided PC lessons from very beginning, which was very rare in China since PCs had not been widely spread at that time. In school, he learnt a lot basic uses of computer mostly under Windows 95. Soon after that, at the age of 8, these knowledges could no longer satisfy him any more. Then him father promised him a PC at home, which was very expensive at that time. The night of that day was the first night he got insomnia in his memory. After he got his own computer, unlike others children at his age, he showed no interests on games and prefered to learn something on his own. In his primary school, he taught himself the uses of Office, Flash, Dreamweaver, Visual Basic, DOS, etc. He ran deeply into these softwares and reached the level higher than most adults at that time. From that time on, he never stop learning and chasing his own dream till now.</p>

<p>Aside from Learning on his own, Qiao never peformed any hesitation on communicating with any one else. He is one of the leaders in the computer league in his primary school. They got meeting everyday after school discussing new technologies, learning together and talking with Mr Zhang, the teacher in charge and a very kind and energetic man. While this is just a beginning. In high school, during 2005 to 2008, he attended school's programing competition team, which mainly focused on Pascal.</p>

<p>Qiao was usually well known as a nice tech-supporter both for teachers and students during his school life. He began to help his friends reinstall operating system since 2000, when he was just a 11 years old little boy. With no auto processing on system installation at that time, he could modify BIOS, use floppy disk to boot, and use DOS commands such as "format" and "fdisk" easily. In school, he was an often visitor of teachers' office. Whenever they had troubles in doing sorting or functioning on Excel forms, they tended to Qiao for help. In middle school, he even gave his Chinese teacher a lesson on Powerpoint when she was confused by making a ppt for her class. Moreover, he was in charge of all electrical devices such as projector and camera in his classroom since his middle school age.</p>

<p>Merged all of himself into new technologies, aside from just reading books, Qiao keep collecting informations from internet, magazines, which has become his everyday hobby. He was a constant reader of a famous magazine -- "Computer Amateur" for ten years and he really like the magazine "Populaces Hardware", and kept reading it for four years until its suspension of publication. For this reason, he finally decided to study hardware design when he was enrolled by Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2008.</p>
