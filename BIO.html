<p>Qiao Gao was born on July 11th, 1989 in Zhengzhou China. At the age of 3, he showed great interests on playing a DOS Pool game on the computer in his father's office. Noticing his curiosity on computers, his parents sent him to a primary school that provided PC lessons from very beginning, which was very rare in China since PCs had not been widely spread at that time. In school, he learnt a lot basic uses of computer mostly under Windows 95. Soon after that, at the age of 8, these knowledges could no longer satisfy him any more. Then his father promised him a PC at home, which was very expensive at that time. The night of that day was the first night he got insomnia in his memory. After he got his own computer, unlike others children at his age, he showed no interests on games and prefered to learn something on his own. In his primary school, he taught himself the uses of Office, Flash, Dreamweaver, Visual Basic, DOS, etc. He ran deeply into these softwares and reached the level higher than most adults at that time. From that time on, he never stop learning and chasing his own dream till now.</p>

<p>Aside from Learning on his own, Qiao never peformed any hesitation on communicating with any one else. He was one of the leaders in the computer league in his primary school. They got meeting everyday after school discussing new technologies, learning together and talking with Mr Zhang, the teacher in charge and a very kind and energetic man. While this is just a beginning. In high school, during 2005 to 2008, he attended school's programing competition team, which mainly focused on Pascal.</p>

<p>Qiao was usually well known as a nice tech-supporter both for teachers and students during his school life. He began to help his friends reinstall operating system since 2000, when he was just a 11 years old little boy. With no auto processing on system installation at that time, he could modify BIOS, use floppy disk to boot, and use DOS commands such as "format" and "fdisk" easily. In school, he was an often visitor of teachers' office. Whenever they had troubles in doing sorting or functioning on Excel forms, they tended to Qiao for help. In middle school, he even gave his Chinese teacher a lesson on Powerpoint when she was confused by making a ppt for her class. Moreover, he was in charge of all electrical devices such as projector and camera in his classroom since his middle school age.</p>

<p>Merged all of himself into new technologies, aside from just reading books, Qiao keep collecting informations from every where he can. Reading through internet and magazines has become his everyday hobby. He was a constant reader of a famous magazine in China-- "Computer Amateur" for ten years and also he really liked the magazine "Populaces Hardware", and kept reading it for four years till its suspension of publication. Therefore, he finally decided to study hardware design when he was accepteded into Xi'an University of Posts and Telecommunications(XUPT), in Xi'an, Shaanxi, China, in 2008.</p>

<p>In XUPT, Qiao began to study software basiss, FPGA, SoC, DSP, and communication theory, under the instruction of many prefessors, including the vice-president of electrical engineering department, Huimin Du, who led Qiao into the world of IC design and gave him great help during his college time. The knowledge attained at university has said to have been invaluable, by Qiao himself. Moreover, Qiao was not necessarily seeking significant attention towards hardware design study. He would like to attend any activity that interests him. In 2010, he led a three people team to join the univisity wide assembly language programing competition and finally got a third prize. Though the result was not extremely good, Qiao felt great excitement and happiness during the process of working with his friends. Thanks to the support from his professor and also his continuing hard working on his study, he got an A on his graduate paper, one of the "Outstanding graduate papers" in his school, and gave a perfect end towards his undergraduate time.</p>

<p>Knowing that the United States is where the lasted techniques are allocated, Qiao made his mind on persueing further education abroad. After few attempts of admission in 2012, he was finally accepted by Illinois Institute of Technology(IIT), Chicago, IL, USA. As a graduate student in IIT, Qiao goes further on VLSI and SoC design with Jafar Sanie, Erdal Oruklu, and some other nice professors, and begin to deal with something more difficult, chalenging and meanwhile more interesting.</p>

<p>Currently, Qiao is still an IIT student. As one of those who are chasing their dreams in America, Qiao is working hard everyday and his curiosity on new techniques is just like the very beginning and will never fade.</p>
